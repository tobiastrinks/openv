`openv` enables you to easily manage application environment variables in 1Password without
putting them plaintext on disk (e.g. into `.env`-files, `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, ...).

This way you can continue using 1Password as a central secret storage and even
share certain environment configurations with your colleagues via 1Password shared vaults!

## Setup

1. __Installation__ \
     using Homebrew
    ```
    brew cask install 1password-cli
    brew tap tobiastrinks/openv
    brew install openv
    ```
    or using npm (requires installing the 1Password CLI manually: [official page](https://1password.com/de/downloads/command-line/))
    ```
    npm install -g @ttrinks/openv
    ```

2. __1Password CLI Setup__ \
    `openv` uses the official 1Password CLI to access your vaults and set secrets. More
    information: https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/
    ```
    op signin example.1password.com wendy_appleseed@example.com
    ```

3. __(Optional) enable auto-completion__ \
    Auto-completion helps you when selecting the secret from your 1Password CLI by name. (Only fully supported on MacOS)
    ```
   openv install-completion
   ```

## Usage

1. __create new `Secure Note` on 1Password__ \
    The notes content must comply to the `.env` [RFC 2 specification](https://smartmob-rfc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-dotenv.html)
    <img src="./docs/sample-secure-note.png" alt="Secure note" width="400"/>

2. __start 1Password session__
    ```
    op signin
    ```

3. __Run your command with secret environment variables__
    ```
   openv postgres-staging -c psql
   ```

## Advanced usage
```
Options
      --help          View manual
      --command, -c   The command you want to execute
      --env, -e       Manually overwrite values from 1Password note
```

The `--command` flag is optional. If left blank `openv` will return the environment variables from your 1Password
Secure Note to `stdout`. You can utilize this for more advanced use-cases like exporting them to your current shell:
```
export $(openv <secure-note-name>)
```

You can also specify multiple `--env` flags, to overwrite certain Secure Note variables. This enables you to easily
adjust the environment without changing the Secure Note or creating multiple just slightly different Secure Notes
to cover your use-cases.
```
openv <secure-note-name> -c <command> -e DBHOST=localhost -e DBPASSWORD=1234
```

## Security

As `openv` is able to read the secrets you store in the requested
`Secret Note` you should inspect the source code to ensure that you
trust the software.

`openv` is unable to read your Master-Password, as it relies on the 1password-cli to access your vault.
