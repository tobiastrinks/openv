`openv` enables you to easily manage application environment variables in 1Password without
putting them plaintext on disk (e.g. into `.env`-files, `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, ...).

This way you can continue using 1Password as a central secret storage and even
share certain environment configurations with your colleagues via 1Password shared vaults!

## Setup

1. __Installation__ \
     using Homebrew
    ```
    brew cask install 1password-cli
    brew tap tobiastrinks/openv
    brew install openv
    ```
    or using npm
    ```
    # requires installing the 1Password CLI manually: https://1password.com/de/downloads/command-line/
    npm install -g @ttrinks/openv
    ```

2. __1Password CLI Setup__ \
    `openv` uses the official 1Password CLI to access your vaults and set secrets. To authenticate
    checkout: https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/
    ```
    op signin example.1password.com wendy_appleseed@example.com
    ```

3. __(Optional) enable auto-completion__ \
    Auto-completion helps you when selecting the secret from your 1Password CLI by name. (Only fully supported on MacOS)
    ```
   openv install-completion
   ```

## Usage

1. __create new `Secure Note` on 1Password__ \
    This content of the note must comply to the `.env` [RFC 2 specification](https://smartmob-rfc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-dotenv.html)
    ![secure note](./docs/sample-secure-note.png)

2. __start 1Password session__
    ```
    op signin
    ```

3. __Run your command with secret environment variables__
    ```
   openv postgres-staging -c psql
   ```

## Security

As `openv` is able to read the secrets you store in the requested
`Secret Note` you should inspect the source code to ensure that you
trust the software.
